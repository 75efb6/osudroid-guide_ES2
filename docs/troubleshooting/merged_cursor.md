#### My cursor merges with each other when I stream or when my aim finger gets close to my streaming fingers.

Unfortunately, this cannot be fixed as it is your deviceâ€™s hardware problem. What you can do is move your streaming fingers away when they get close to each other or when your aim fingers move towards them. This prevents your cursors from merging into one cursor.
