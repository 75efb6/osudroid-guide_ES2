#### My osu!droid profile page shows the wrong location/flag or no flag at all.

The osu!droid game server tracks your location (which is what your country flag is based on) based on your IP address. If you want to change your flag, you will need to change your location. This is how you do it:
1. Use a VPN or switch from mobile data to Wi-Fi or vice versa.
2. Open osu!droid and make sure that you are connected to the server.
3. Play a beatmap and submit the result to the server. It doesn’t matter if your score does not overwrite your best score (if present), all that matters is the score is sent to the server.

That’s it!

If your location doesn’t change or it changes to a wrong location, you will need to use a VPN that is hosted in the location you want to change your location into, albeit mobile data usually works.
