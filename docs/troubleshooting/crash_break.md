#### The game keeps crashing whenever I enter a significantly long break period in a beatmap.

**OUTDATED: FIXED IN LATEST VERSION**

If you are using a skin, go to your skin directory and delete sectionpass and sectionfail audio file. Any audio file with size 0 B or 44 B may crash the game under certain conditions, therefore it is advised to delete any audio file with those sizes in your skin.
