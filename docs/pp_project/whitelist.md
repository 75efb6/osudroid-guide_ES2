#### What is "whitelist"?

Whitelist is the process of allowing non-ranked beatmaps to give dpp. In other words, this is the ranking system of dpp apart from ranked, approved, and loved beatmaps. The beatmaps are validated by pp-project map validators. They can be identified by the `@pp-project Map Validator` role in the Discord server. You can check [this](https://droidpp.osudroid.moe/whitelist) website to see the list of whitelisted beatmaps.
