#### What is whitelist?

Whitelist is the process of allowing non-ranked beatmaps to give dpp. In other words, this is the ranking system of dpp apart from ranked/approved/loved beatmaps. The beatmaps are validated by pp-project map validators. They can be identified by the @pp-project Map Validator role on the server. You can check [this](https://ppboard.herokuapp.com/whitelist) website to see the list of whitelisted beatmaps.
