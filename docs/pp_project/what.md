#### I see the channel #elaina-pp-project on the server. What is that? Is that supposed to be a future pp system for the game?

Elaina PP project is an implementation of the pp system for osu!droid, commonly called “dpp” (acronym for “droid pp”).

While this system represents an actual pp system for the game, it is still in a very crude state where a lot of rebalances must be made. Furthermore, the project is currently not affiliated with the game.
