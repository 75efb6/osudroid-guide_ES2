#### I see the channel #elaina-pp-project on the server. What is that? Is that supposed to be a future pp system for the game?

Elaina PP project is a very basic and hack-ish (hence the name “project”) pp system, commonly called “dpp” (acronym for “droid pp”), which was created and maintained by the server owners.

While this system represents an actual pp system for the game, it is still in a very crude state where a lot of rebalances must be made. Furthermore, the project is not affiliated with the game at all. Therefore, it will never be implemented in the game.
