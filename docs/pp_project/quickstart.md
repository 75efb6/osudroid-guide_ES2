#### Getting started with Elaina PP Project

To get started with Elaina PP Project, you will need an osu!droid account.
Keep in mind that this process can only be done in the [osu!droid Discord server](https://discord.gg/nyD92cE) inside the `#elaina-pp-project` or `#bot-ground` channels.

1. If you haven’t already, you need to bind your osu!droid account with your Discord account. Go to one of the said channels and use `/userbind` to bind your osu!droid account with your Discord account. You must specify your email in the option provided.
2. All dpp-related commands are available via the `/pp` main command. The main sub-commands are noted down below.
- By default, all of your scores are automatically submitted, following a certain criterion that is pretty modest. Otherwise, to submit your plays, use `/pp submit`. You can use `/pp submit beatmap` to submit your play in a specific beatmap or `/pp submit recent` to submit your most recent plays.
- Keep in mind that you can only submit your 50 most recent plays via command submission. For example:
    - `/pp submit recent amount:3` submits your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd most recent play
    - `/pp submit recent amount:5 offset:10` submits your 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th most recent play
    - `/pp submit recent amount:3 offset:18` submits your 18th, 19th, and 20th most recent play
    - `/pp submit recent amount:7` (7>5) is invalid as you can only submit up to 5 plays at once
    - `/pp submit recent amount:5 offset:49` is invalid as you can only submit your 50 most recent plays. This command would submit your 49th, 50th, 51st, 52nd, and 53rd most recent play (maximum you can do is `/pp submit recent amount:5 offset:46`)
- If you want to submit all of your previous plays, please contact a person with the `@Language Helper`, `@Language Moderator`, or `@Global Moderator` role in the Discord server.
<!-- TODO: link to "what is whitelist?" guide -->
- Only ranked, approved, loved, and whitelisted beatmaps are eligible for granting performance points.
3. To view your current list of plays, use `/pp check`.

And that’s all you need to know!
