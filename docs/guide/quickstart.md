The game will do everything else for you. *The UI for the downloader has been changed, but the instructions here should still applied*

9. If you have played osu! before. You are done, go figure! But if you are completely new. Here is how to play the game:
    - See the circle? Tap it when the outer circle shrinks to match the inner one (Feel the rhythm on this. It's a rhythm game after all)
    ![Alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Screenshot_20231007-183218.png)
    - See the slider? Tap the circle at the beginning of it and hold it until the end of the slider (There should be a ball that moves along the slider. Follow it)

    ![Alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Screenshot_20231007-183314.png)
    *There might be arrow at the end of a slider, it will force the slider ball go backward, keep that in mind*
    
    - See the spinner? Drag your finger around the center of the screen to spin (This is the easiest one. Just spin it fast. You don't need to follow the rhythm)
    ![Alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Screenshot_20231007-184159.png)
    - What matter is how well you timed your tap. The game will give you a score based on that (300 - 100 - 50 - Miss (also happen if you tap in the wrong place))
    - See the bar on top? Do well and the bar will not deplete until you finished the map. Otherwise you fail the map and you have to restart.
    - Hold it until the end of the song and you are done! You have submitted your score to the leaderboard
    ![Alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Screenshot_20231007-190815.png)

That's it. You have installed the game, get beatmaps, play them and submit the score to the online database. The rest is up to you. Good luck!
