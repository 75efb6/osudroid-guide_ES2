#### How do I add/import skins?

1. If you choose to create your own skin, it will be a long process. There are many tutorials on the internet on how you can make a skin for the game. Otherwise, you can go to https://tsukushi.site/ and select one that suits you. you can also request from players provided that they want to share their skin. It is not advised to download osu! (not osu!droid) skins as many of them are incompatible with the game.
2. If you enabled scan download directory settings in-game, you can quickly launch the game to import the skin.

*There are some cases where this wonâ€™t work, for example if your skin folder is in an external storage such as an SD card. If this is the case, continue to step 3.*
3. If the skin file is in .osk extension, you have to convert it to .zip first.
4. Extract the contents to /osu!droid/Skins/ folder (by default). Make sure that the order is set correctly: /osu!droid/Skins/{SKIN_NAME}/{SKIN_ELEMENTS}.
5. After you have finished extracting, enter the game and go to options -> advanced options -> select skin. Select the skin that you have just extracted, and you should be good to go.
