#### I see osu!droid in Google Play Store. Which one should I download?

The only official sources of the game are from [the osu!droid website](https://osudroid.moe) and [its GitHub website](https://github.com/osudroid/osu-droid). The developers have no future plans to release the game to Google Play Store nor will they ever do so.

If you ever stumble upon a clone of the game in the Google Play Store, please be mindful that the name "osu!" is trademarked by ppy Pty Ltd. As such, you may submit a notification email regarding the game to pe@ppy.sh.
