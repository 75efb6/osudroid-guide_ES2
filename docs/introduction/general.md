#### What is this game? How do I play it?

This game is an Android port of the popular rhythm game “[osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/)”. It was originally created in 2011 by pesets, and later maintained by Neico. To read more about osu!, you can go to [osu!wiki](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Main_page). What is mentioned in that page mostly applies in the port as well.
