**Deleting a beatmapset**
- Option A: Go to the Songs folder (at `osu!droid/Songs`) with your favourite file browser and find the beatmap folder you want to delete, delete them, and then MAKE SURE to at least go to the beatmap select in-game once for the library cache to be reloaded and the beatmapset is truly deleted
- Option B: In the map selection screen, hold touch the beatmap panel of the map you selected and want to delete until an option pops up with Delete Map button, press it, and then MAKE SURE to at least go to the main menu and then go back to the beatmap select in-game once for the library cache to be reloaded and the beatmapset is truly deleted

**Updating a beatmapset**
- Make sure you deleted the beatmapset with 2 option above
- Download the updated version of the beatmapset
- Just to be certain, rename the .osz file to be a different name to help the game recognize the set need to be imported 
- Open the game and let it do the rest
