- If the place where the ranking panel usually are is not visible: Check the "Server Connection" option in Options > Account Option
- If the panel display "Cannot log in - Wrong name or password": Check your username/password combination. If necessary you can try to reset your password via [osu!droid Website](https://osudroid.moe) login prompt
- If the panel stuck on "Logging in... - Connecting to server...":
  - Check if you can access [osu!droid Website](https://osudroid.moe). If you can, you can try to clear the the app's cache or reinstall the game
  - If you cannot access the site, It means your Internet Service Provider has blocked your request to the osu!droid Website
    - In case they block your DNS query (more common, you should assume this is the case first). You can change your device's DNS setting to use "Private DNS"
    - In case they block the game's IP. Please use a VPN before logging into the game (i.e. ProtonVPN provide a free plan with limited speed, TunnelBear provide a free plan with limited data cap, both should be suffice due to the small traffic the game create. P.S. Not sponsored)
