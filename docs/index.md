## osu!droid Guide

Welcome to osu!droid Guide, the one-stop shop for all things related to osu!droid. This guide is intended to help new players get started with the game and to help existing players with their problems. This guide is also intended to be a replacement for the legacy FAQ section on the wordpress osudroidfaq site.

This guide is still a work in progress. If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to open an issue or pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NeroYuki/osudroid-guide)
