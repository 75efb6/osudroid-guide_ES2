#### Can I change my registered email, password, and in-game name?

For registered email and password:

1. Go to [this](https://osudroid.moe/user?action=login) page and login with your osu!droid account credentials (in-game name and password).
2. Once youâ€™re logged in, go to settings. In there, you can change your email and password.

The settings button that you will need to press after you login to the page.
Do note that **you cannot change your email if the new email is connected to another osu!droid account.**

For in-game name, you need to request a name change. Unfortunately, this is currently only possible to do via the [osu!droid (International) Discord server](https://discord.gg/nyD92cE). Once you join the server, you may type `/namechange request` and fill in the required options to request a name change.
