#### How can I find my profile page on the website?

To find your profile page:

1. Open osu!droid.
2. Tap on your profile on the top-left corner of your screen in the main menu.
3. You will be prompted to view your profile page. Press "Yes" to view your profile page.
4. You will see a new screen, with your uid given in there. You can use it to view your profile page by inserting it to the `https://osudroid.moe/profile.php?uid={uid}` URL, where `{uid}` is your uid. For example: `https://osudroid.moe/profile.php?uid=5455`.
