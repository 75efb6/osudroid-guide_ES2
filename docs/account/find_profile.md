#### How can I find my profile page on the website?

To find your profile page, simply type /profile view usernamer:<username> in #bot-ground. If your account was found, an embed with a hyperlink to your profile page will be sent.

In the upcoming version (1.6.8), you can open the game and tap on your profile on the top-left corner of your screen to instantly go to your profile page.
