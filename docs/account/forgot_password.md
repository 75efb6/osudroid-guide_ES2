#### Iâ€™ve lost my account/account credentials! Can I retrieve it back?

There are a few conditions whereby an account can be retrieved:
- If you forgot your password, you can go to [this](https://osudroid.moe/user?action=reset) page to reset your password.
- If you forgot your username:
  - If you remember your registered email, you can go to [this](https://osudroid.moe/user?action=login) page to login with it. You should then be able to see your username.
  - If you remember your uid, you can append your uid into the following URL: `https://osudroid.moe/profile.php?uid=` to view your profile. Your username will be visible in the page.

If your condition is not specified in the aforementioned conditions, it is not possible to retrieve your osu!droid account.
