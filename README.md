# Contribution Guide
### For contributor with no programming background

You can suggest changes via the website and you will be redirected to that page's editor. The editor should follow the Jekyll markdown format (see the cheatsheet [here](https://itopaloglu83.github.io/Jekyll-Markdown-Cheat-Sheet/)). After that if there is a big green button, just hit it until you have made a "Pull Request". And you are done!

**Simplified terminology:**
- Fork: your copy of the site (your edit will be there first, obviously i can just allow you to straight up edit the site lol)
- Pull Request: your request to change the page with your change

### For programmer with the know-how

Clone the repository and setup a local development environment for Github Pages (See the guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)). 
Please note that the page directory is /docs and default baseurl is /osudroid-guide (need to be config to empty string whether by `_config.yml` or command args `--baseurl=""`). After got the page run on your local environment go figure!
